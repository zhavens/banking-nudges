    <h3>Welcome to the Proxy Caregiver's Banking Prototype</h3>
    <div class="col-6">
        This is a prototype of an online banking interface designed to support people who bank on behalf of an older
        adult. This relies on the concept of a "proxy account" where you log in with your own username and password, but
        have the ability to perform banking tasks on behalf of another.
        <hr>
        Everything in the prototype is fake. Bank of Bank is not a real bank, and does not manage any real money.
        Everything is entirely on your own computer, and no data is saved to a server or database anywhere.

        If you are interested in participating in the study related to this prototype, please see the <a
            href="https://celinelatulipe.net/gathering-feedback-on-banking-interfaces-for-caregivers/"
            target="_blank">study website</a> where you'll find details about the study, including instructions on how
        to get involved! For the time being, you can "register" an account locally to try the prototype out.

        If you are a participant in the study, thank you for taking part! You will already have an account created that
        you may use, the credentials for which are in your guidebook provided by the research team. Please continue to
        refer to that guidebook for the list of tasks we would like you to perform, and don't forget to think aloud!
